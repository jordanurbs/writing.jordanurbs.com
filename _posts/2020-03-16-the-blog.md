I'm writing again. A return to who I once was, before I decided to try to be a social entpreneur-ing filmmaker and dedicated my creative energy elsewhere.

It's been a long ride from age 26 until now, 32, but now that life is slowing down a bit I am happy to bring my mind to text once again.

Welcome.
