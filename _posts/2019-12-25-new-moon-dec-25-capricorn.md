forgiveness

acceptance of acceptance

receiving of love

expressive in purity

not judging its source

I give and I receive

I've given and I've received

I give and I receive

I create and I deserve

I love and I cherish

**she just wants to loves me....**

all my ego-ic & lustful fantasies disintegrated in the field of her love

the "me" aspects of love in those fantasies stay with us.

LOVE WILL BURN IT ALL UP... JUST LET IT.
