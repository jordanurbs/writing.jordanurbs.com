It's the very last day of the lunar year, and a time for me to reflect. A lot has passed and I have grown tremendously in the past year.

I've shared my life with a partner and have known consistent love and acceptance. The product of our love may very well be born tomorrow, on the lunar new year...

I've been learning to shift my reaction from "fight and resist" to "accept and make peace." It's always within me, when all is said and done.

I'm excited to become a father. I see my own father in a new light. I notice how I still seek his approval and I want to honor him. I want my son to feel accepted and loved by me no matter what.

Meanwhile, I've surrendered ontrol of my diet, exercise, alcohol consumption, et cetera, and I am more relaxed and healthy than ever. This is the first spring in at least four years that I have no back or body problems affecting me in a serious manner. None!

My professional projects are coming to a head. There is a vortex swirling, people are swishing around in it, and I even feel like the resources are starting to show up with less and less "forcing it" on my part. Things make more sense now.

Oh yeah, and the world is freaking out about a disease that only affects certain people, primarily the elderly and immuno-compromised. Panic and hysteria has hit _hard_, it seems to be in the very air we breathe.

The economy has also crashed.

Somehow I feel opportunity despite dark times for society.

And we're having a baby.

We're making a home.

This is the first time in my adult life I've tried to make a plan for settling down months in advance; but due to the state of the world and its uncertain future right now, I have literally zero control over where I'll be and why.

_I love it!_ says the spiritual part of me that knows surrender is the only path to bliss...
