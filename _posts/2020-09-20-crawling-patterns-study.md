This is the film that got me following Budokon. I started watching Cameron’s instagram clips and tried mimicking them. What I was gathering by imitation online was helping my back issues—a lot. When they finally announced their online academy this February, I was all-in.

It’s been an absolute life-changing experience to jump into this stuff head-on with the BDK Mobility TT—so let’s dive into what Cameron says in this film to discuss a bit of the why this might be so impactful for me:

As humans, the natural placement of the pelvis has gone from an anterior tilt (like other primates), to a posterior tilt, which puts stress on the head of the femur… and the resulting pressure congests the nearby muscles (likely constituting 90% of my f*cking back issues)

On our knees and four paws, though, we relax the femur back into a position more reminiscent of other primates. “Crawling patterns” give us an opportunity to balance out the strength of both our lower and upper trunks together. (Not to mention, there’s something about using your upper trunk that just gives you more confidence and well-being in this life.)

Both upper and lower trunk strength is equally necessary to be an animal/primate; yet our human social environment is designed only for two legs and holding a cell phone.  Or sitting at a desk. Or walking around. So not only is the full body getting the chance to express itself with strength and mobility, but the posterior pelvic tilt is busy cramping our style. Imagine that.

In other human-developed practices over time, we have seen integrations of animal concepts. Kung-fu seems to mimic how animals may fight or get into fighting position, while yoga demonstrates animal positions in asanas (albeit, very structured and not at all how animals would likely use those poses—even dogs don’t stay in upward/downward dog for very long). 

But in BDK, Cameron Shayne, the man himself is more interested in how animals locomote. How people can be more functional users of their own bodies for their own goals. And I think that spreads beyond physical activity, and that’s what makes Budokon such a powerful practice… it’s a metaphor for well-being. If you’re not commanding your vessel in its most optimal form possible, are you engaging with the best version of yourself?
