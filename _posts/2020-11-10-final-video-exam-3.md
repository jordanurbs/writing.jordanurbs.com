I won't embellish my feelings on this assignment. It would have been my favorite, had I not unleashed a new error in my back while rehearsing this sequence:

After 3 weeks of a bothered sacroiliac joing and psoaz--a triggering chain of events meant to teach me something, to be sure--I was finally able to move my body well enough to share this with someone. It was a good experience, one in which I felt very free, and I look forward to more opportunities to practice sharing BDK Mobility. 

Sharing it also helped me develop the sequence further and see how it can be applied to practictioners at any level. A little of that exploration can be seen in the video, which I have cut down from an hour to save some time for reviewing eyes. Enjoy.
