**(1/26)** I'm suddenly so easily grateful...

do these new moon intentions happen regardless of my conscious efort or motivation?

it's like I know where I want to go, who to be

and the work is almost an unneeded step--

BECAUSE I AM ALREADY THERE!

_(past the bullshit)_

**(1/27)** This sudden and strange gratitude... surrender... "love" for myself,

the act of not stressing, #CHILLBRO, could it be a reflection of the strongest, purest love I've ever known?
