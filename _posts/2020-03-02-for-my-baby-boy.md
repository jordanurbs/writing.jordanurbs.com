If there's one thing I've learned,

that I can do my best to apply to myself,

so I can thus offer it to my son, it's

to bring him into a world of peace.

An environment lacking the human chaos

created by a father lost in the

infinite swirls of being, teetering

on the finite, remembering and forgetting,

not proving much to material

society in the process...

Aquiles, you won't be my reason for being,

but perhaps you'll be my being for reason.

You will experience the love that comes

from a man who has finally realized

that life does not require a reason for being.

Forget the business.

Forget the art.

Forget the music.

Forget the service.

Forget the diet.

Forget the morals.

I want to be at peace.

For my baby boy.
