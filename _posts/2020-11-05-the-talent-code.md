<em>The Talent Code</em> explores the concept of talent while studying what "success" means and how different communities around the world have seemed to unlock it. Author Daniel Coyle found a few distinctive traits to areas where talent seemed to arise with more ease and frequency than other areas--talent hotbeds. Is talent unique to personality or culture, genes or environment, or is it simply a neurological equation?

The book essentially explores that question. Coyle argues that talent is ours to code, and there are foundational components to that code and how the brain is wired to code that talent. Here are my takeaways:

### Ignition: A Revelatory Moment
This is the moment when everything changes for the child. Students must SEE amazing performances and awe-inspiring feats in order to understand that THIS IS POSSIBLE. Because before it's perceived, it's just a dream, a fantasy. Revelatory moments are pivotal in creating the desire inside someone to even consider attempting to code talent into themselves.

I find this one important because it's what put me on any kind of personal, self-growth journey to begin with. Many "spiritual" experiences I've had with plant medicines, breathwork, and yoga have lead to the most profound states of being I've ever found myself in. They were always  life-changing but never happened more than once. Their purpose was to show me that these states are real and obtainable, something to work towards making a more common part of my life--and it stuck with me for years to come.

Still working on that 10,000 hours though.

### Master Coaching 
1. Explanation
2. Demonstration
3. Imitation
4. Correction
5. Repetition

### Environmental Reinforcements 
Coaches, parents, teachers, etc must create an environment around the child that continues to reinforce what's possible (and subjectively, what's important). They must continue to see the performances, be encouraged to practice, and most importantly, to believe that they can also achieve these feats.

I think this part speaks for itself. What we are surrounded by and the information we constantly receive creates our reality.

### Primal Cues to Belong
This has to do with pushing the student to the edge--because tension is how we learn and grow as humans. Putting the child into that state of challenge creates an inner drive to push themselves and put in the practie required to become exceptional.

Speaking of practice.... 

### Myelin, Repetition, Mistakes

What I would have called 'muscle memory' is actually a process to do with neurons traveling around the brain and also has a lot to do with neuroplasticity and the concepts of habits. The faster the neurons can move, the more effective or quickly an activity is performed. Protecting the traveling neurons in the brain is a fatty substance called 'myelin', which apparently creates a smoother ride for those neurons. 

How to create more myelin? Deep practice and hard work. What is deep practice and hard work often comprised of? <strong>Repetition. Making mistakes, fixing them.</strong> The more you practice, the fatter that myelin tissue gets and soon practice makes perfect.

practice, in order to continue refine skills and add fat to the myelin, segmenting work into the smallest possible units eventually becomes the only way to recognize what work is left to do. It's the art of mastery.

I equate this final segment to the BDK movement practice in general, where it's often easier to move faster through a given transition because the muscle and myelin have not developed around the movement sufficiently enough to move slowly. Thus dividing up a sequence into individual transitions, and really focusing on the smallest of movements, allows for the body-brain connection to enhance, build muscle, and create greatness.

Pretty neat stuff. I haven't had any ignition moments lately but maybe something will come up soon :)
