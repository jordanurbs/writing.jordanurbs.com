  I'm really into the phenomenological experience of structuring information. I'm really into community networking.
  
  In recent times I've discovered passion in figuring out the challenges that arise from presenting our human experience within community-brand frameworks. We are stronger together.

  This is a place where I share my experience with one such community-brand--the <a href="https://budokon.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">Budokon Mobility Teacher Training</a>--while exploring front-end solutions to mapping out human perspectives.
